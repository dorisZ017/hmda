# Lending Discrimination analysis with HMDA Dataset

This project aims to determine whether minorities are discriminated against lending based on data from HMDA program, which is an open-source dataset with records of house mortage applications and their applicants.

I selected data from California and Texas in 2010 and 2013 in this project.

The IPython Notebook in this repo contains the process of my analysis and codes, including data cleaning, feature engineering, modeling, automated hypothesis tests, and final conclusion with a summary of questions I addressed during the process.
