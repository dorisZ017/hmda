So I created a new variable called 'minority_ratio', which is the ratio of minority population to the total population of the tract. Regarding the economic status of the tract where the property is located, instead of 'tract_to_msamd_income', the percentage of the median family income for the tract compared to the median family income for the MSA/MD, the absolute value of median income of the tract makes more sense. So I created another new value called 'tract_median_income', which is calculated by 'tract_to_msamd_income' * 'hud_median_family_income'. Then 'tract_to_msamd_income' and 'hud_median_family_income' are excluded to avoid dependency among variables."

    "According to the result of random forest model, it can be observed that the most important features affecting application's result are applicant's income and the amount of loan, followed by some tract-related variables, including 'tract_median_income', 'minority_ratio', 'number_of_owner_occupied_units', and 'number_of_1_to_4_family_units'. It can be concluded that the economic status and demographic status of where the property is located are also affecting the success rate of a loan application. Following amount of loan are income and tract-related variables are lien status, lien of the mortgage and loan purposes. These variables, along variables indicating the race and ethnicity of the applicant, are included for further analysis."

This goes same with number of owner-occupied units of the tract, number of 1-to-4 family units of the tract, loan amount and the applicant's income. If the application's property is located in tract with lower ratio of minority population, it tends to be approved, while properties of minorities' applications tend to locate in tracts with higher ratio of minority population."

    "To control the tract-related variables, I simply selected records from the same tract. To control the loan amount and income to be the same, I selected a subset of all records where based on T-test, the means of income and loan amount of minority group and non-minority group are approximately equal, respectively. Given that for most tracts, number of minority applicants are much smaller than the number of non-minority applicants, the goal basically to select a subset of non-minority applicants whose average income and loan amount are approximately equal to those of minority applicants in the tract. I did this by sorting the applicants by income and loan amount and perform T-test on both mean income and mean loan amount (since the distribution of income and loan amount is skewed, I actually performed T-test on logarithm of them). If the null hypothesis of equal means cannot be rejected, it is considered that they are approximately equal. If based on T-test, the null hypothesis of equal means is rejected, check if the mean income of selected non-minority group is larger or smaller than that of minority group. If it is larger, exclude the record with largest income from selected non-minority group, and if it is smaller, exclude the record with smallest income from selected non-minority group. Repeat these steps until the two groups are considered approximately equal on both income and loan amount. Then calculate and compare the approval rate of minority applicants and non-minority applicants to see if they are significantly different. To ensure accuracy, the remaining records of each group should be more than 30. Tracts with no more than 30 records on each group after multiple times of excluding will not be considered in analysis. With most important variables controlled to be almost the same, if there is still significant difference between approval rate of minority applicants and non-minority applicants, it can be considered minorities are discriminated against lending in this tract. \n",
